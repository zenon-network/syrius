/// Represents the various statuses a cubit can have during its lifecycle.

/// This enum is used to track and emit different states:
enum CubitStatus {
  /// Indicates that the cubit has encountered an error.
  failure,
  /// The initial state before any data has been loaded.

  /// Data is currently being fetched.
  loading,

///
/// The [DashboardState] is designed to be generic, with [T] representing the
/// type of data that is managed by each specific cubit state (e.g., balances,
/// transactions, etc.). Subclasses like `BalanceState` extend this class to
/// handle specific data types.
///
/// The state includes:
/// - [status]: A [CubitStatus] that indicates the current state (loading,
/// success, etc.).
/// - [data]: The data of type [T] that is managed by the cubit.
/// - [error]: An optional [error] object that contains error details if the
/// cubit is in a failure state.

  /// - The [data] and [error] can be null, indicating that either no data has
