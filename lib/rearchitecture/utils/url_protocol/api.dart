/// https://github.com/llfbandit/app_links/tree/master/app_links/example/lib

/// Registers a protocol by [scheme] to allow for links in the form `<scheme>://...`
/// to be processed by this application. By default, opening a link will open
/// the executable that was used to register the scheme with the URL as the first
/// argument passed to the executable.
///
/// If a protocol is already registered for the given scheme, this function will
/// attempt to overwrite the previous handler with the current executable information.
/// However, note that depending on process permissions, this operation may be
/// disallowed by the underlying platform.
///
/// You may pass an [executable] to override the path to the executable to run
/// when accessing the URL.
///
/// [arguments] is a list of arguments to be used when running the executable.
/// If passed, the list must contain at least one element, and at least one of
/// those elements must contain the literal value `%s` to denote the URL to open.
/// Quoting arguments is not necessary, as this will be handled for you.
/// Escaping the `%s` as an unprocessed literal is currently unsupported.
